1. Web & Mobile Development (React Native + Expo)


2. Backend (by "mangos" — you probably mean Mongoose for MongoDB or NestJS if you meant “mangos framework”).
I’ll cover both cases below.

🧠 TOP CONCEPTS IN WEB & MOBILE DEVELOPMENT (React Native + Expo)

⚙️ 1. Core React Native Concepts

Components – Functional & Class components

Props & State – Data passing & dynamic updates

Hooks – useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef, useCallback, etc.

Navigation – react-navigation (Stack, Drawer, Tab Navigators)

Styling – Flexbox, StyleSheet, Tailwind (NativeWind), or styled-components

Responsive UI – Adapting layout for all device sizes

Expo SDK – Prebuilt APIs (Camera, Notifications, Permissions, FileSystem, etc.)

Native Modules – Linking custom native code if needed



---

⚡ 2. Advanced Concepts

State Management – Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Recoil, Jotai, or Context API

API Integration – REST & GraphQL using Axios or Apollo

Authentication – JWT, OAuth, Firebase Auth

Offline Storage – AsyncStorage, SQLite, MMKV, Realm

Animations – Reanimated 2, Gesture Handler, Lottie

Push Notifications – Expo Notifications API

Deep Linking – Navigate from URLs or external apps

Environment Setup – .env management, development vs production

App Deployment – Expo EAS Build, App Store, Play Store



---

🌐 3. Web + React Native (Shared Codebase)

Expo + Next.js Integration – “Universal Apps”

Monorepo Setup – TurboRepo for shared components between web and mobile

React Native Web – Run RN components on browsers



---

🖥️ BACKEND DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS (if you mean Mongoose + Node.js / Express)

🧩 1. Core Concepts

Node.js – Event loop, async/await, streams

Express.js – Routes, middleware, error handling

MongoDB – NoSQL database design, collections, documents

Mongoose – Schema, Models, CRUD operations, hooks (pre, post)



---

🔐 2. Advanced Backend

Authentication & Authorization – JWT, OAuth, refresh tokens

Validation – Joi, Zod, or built-in schema validation

File Uploads – Multer or Cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)

API Architecture – RESTful or GraphQL

Error Handling – Centralized error middleware

Security – Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, sanitization

Performance – Caching (Redis), compression, pagination

Testing – Jest, Supertest

Logging – Winston, Morgan

Deployment – Docker, Vercel, Render, AWS, or Railway



---

⚙️ If You Meant NestJS (Mangos framework)

(some people say “mangos” when they mean “NestJS”)
Then these are key concepts:

Modules, Controllers, Providers

Dependency Injection (DI)

Pipes, Guards, Interceptors, Filters

TypeORM / Mongoose integration

GraphQL + REST APIs

Microservices and WebSockets

ConfigModule + Env Management

Swagger Documentation

Testing with Jest



---

🔄 Connecting React Native/Expo to Backend

Axios or Fetch API – To call your backend endpoints

JWT Auth Flow – Login → get token → store in AsyncStorage → attach to headers

WebSocket (Socket.io) – For real-time updates

Error Handling & Refresh Tokens

Secure Endpoints (CORS setup)

🚀 Learning Path (Suggested)

1. Learn React Native + Expo fundamentals


2. Build a simple CRUD mobile app


3. Learn Node.js + Express or NestJS + MongoDB/Mongoose


4. Connect frontend ↔ backend


5. Add auth, file upload, and notifications


6. Deploy both sides (frontend + backend)
