# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models define the **process, structure, and sequence of activities** used to develop high-quality software systems. Different models are chosen based on **project size, complexity, risk level, and customer requirements**.

---

## 1. Waterfall Model

### Introduction
The **Waterfall Model** is the earliest and most traditional SDLC model. It follows a **linear and sequential approach**, where progress flows steadily downward through distinct phases, similar to a waterfall.

### Phases of Waterfall Model
1. **Requirement Analysis** – All system requirements are collected and documented.  
2. **System Design** – Architecture, hardware, and software design are prepared.  
3. **Implementation** – Coding of the software begins.  
4. **Testing** – The developed system is tested for errors and bugs.  
5. **Deployment** – The system is delivered to the customer.  
6. **Maintenance** – Fixes and updates are performed after delivery.

### Characteristics
- One phase must be completed before moving to the next  
- No overlapping of phases  
- Extensive documentation  
- Little customer involvement after requirement phase  

### Advantages
- Simple and easy to understand  
- Well-defined milestones  
- Easy to manage due to rigid structure  
- Suitable for small projects with fixed requirements  

### Disadvantages
- Very difficult to accommodate changes  
- Working software is available very late  
- Errors discovered late increase cost  
- Not suitable for dynamic or complex projects  

### Example
Used in **government or defense projects** where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.

## 2. V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)

### Introduction
The **V-Model** is an enhancement of the Waterfall Model that emphasizes **verification and validation**. Testing is planned early and runs parallel to development activities.

### Structure of V-Model

| Development Phase        | Testing Phase        |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Requirement Analysis    | Acceptance Testing   |
| System Design           | System Testing       |
| Architecture Design     | Integration Testing  |
| Module Design           | Unit Testing         |

### Key Features
- Early test planning  
- Strong focus on quality  
- Defects detected at early stages  
- Parallel development and testing  

### Advantages
- Higher success rate than Waterfall  
- Early bug detection reduces cost  
- Suitable for mission-critical systems  
- Clear traceability between requirements and tests  

### Disadvantages
- Rigid and inflexible  
- Changes are difficult to implement  
- High documentation effort  
- Not suitable for evolving requirements  

### Example
Used in **medical systems, aviation, and embedded systems**.

## 3. Agile Model

### Introduction
The **Agile Model** is a modern and flexible approach focused on **customer satisfaction, continuous feedback, and rapid delivery**. Development is done in small iterations called **increments**.

### Agile Principles
- Individuals and interactions over processes  
- Working software over documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contracts  
- Responding to change over fixed plans  

### Features
- Iterative and incremental development  
- Frequent releases  
- Continuous feedback  
- Cross-functional teams  

### Advantages
- Easily handles changing requirements  
- Faster delivery of usable software  
- Improved customer satisfaction  
- Reduced project risk  

### Disadvantages
- Less documentation  
- Hard to estimate cost and time  
- Requires skilled developers  
- Difficult for large-scale systems  

### Example
Used in **web applications, mobile apps, and startups**.

## 4. Scrum Framework

### Introduction
**Scrum** is an Agile framework designed for managing complex projects. Work is divided into **time-boxed sprints**, usually lasting **2–4 weeks**.

### Scrum Roles
1. **Product Owner** – Defines and prioritizes requirements  
2. **Scrum Master** – Ensures Scrum rules are followed  
3. **Development Team** – Builds the product  

### Scrum Events
- Sprint Planning  
- Daily Stand-up  
- Sprint Review  
- Sprint Retrospective  

### Scrum Artifacts
- Product Backlog  
- Sprint Backlog  
- Increment  

### Advantages
- High transparency  
- Continuous improvement  
- Early issue detection  
- Fast delivery  

### Disadvantages
- Requires disciplined teams  
- Not suitable for large distributed teams  
- Poor results if roles are unclear  

### Example
Used by **software companies like Google, Microsoft, and startups**.

## 5. Spiral Model

### Introduction
The **Spiral Model** focuses on **risk management**. Development proceeds in a series of loops (spirals), and each loop includes planning, risk analysis, development, and evaluation.

### Phases of Each Spiral
1. Planning  
2. Risk Analysis  
3. Engineering  
4. Evaluation  

### Key Features
- Risk-driven approach  
- Frequent prototyping  
- Iterative development  
- Continuous user feedback  

### Advantages
- Best for large and high-risk projects  
- Early identification of risks  
- Flexible and reliable  
- Improved customer satisfaction  

### Disadvantages
- Expensive and complex  
- Requires risk assessment experts  
- Not suitable for small projects  

### Example
Used in **banking systems, aerospace, and large enterprise software**.

## 6. Extreme Programming (XP)

### Introduction
**Extreme Programming (XP)** is an Agile methodology that emphasizes **code quality, simplicity, and customer involvement**.

### Key Practices
- Pair Programming  
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
- Continuous Integration  
- Refactoring  
- Small Releases  

### Advantages
- High-quality code  
- Early bug detection  
- Fast development  
- Better team communication  

### Disadvantages
- Requires constant customer involvement  
- Not suitable for large teams  
- High discipline required  

### Example
Used in projects with **frequently changing requirements**.

## Conclusion

Each SDLC model has its own strengths and weaknesses:

- **Waterfall & V-Model** → Best for stable requirements  
- **Agile, Scrum & XP** → Ideal for dynamic and fast-changing projects  
- **Spiral Model** → Suitable for large, high-risk systems  

Choosing the **right SDLC model** ensures **successful project completion, better quality, and higher customer satisfaction**.
