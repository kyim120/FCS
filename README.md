## 1. Waterfall Model

### Explanation

The Waterfall Model follows a **linear and sequential approach** to software development. Each phase must be fully completed before moving to the next phase, just like water flowing down a waterfall. Once a phase is finished, going back is very difficult.

### Main Features

* Clearly defined stages
* Strict sequence of phases
* Heavy documentation
* No overlapping of phases

### Advantages

* Easy to understand and manage
* Clear milestones and deliverables
* Works well when requirements are fixed and known in advance

### Disadvantages

* Very difficult to handle changes
* Errors found late are costly to fix
* Not suitable for long-term or complex projects

## 2. V-Model (Verification and Validation)

### Explanation

The V-Model is an improved version of the Waterfall Model where **testing is planned alongside development**. Each development stage has a corresponding testing stage, ensuring verification and validation happen early.

### Main Features

* Testing activities are defined early
* Parallel development and testing phases
* Strong emphasis on quality

### Advantages

* Early detection of defects
* Better quality assurance
* Suitable for safety-critical systems

### Disadvantages

* Very rigid like Waterfall
* Changes are expensive
* Requires clear and stable requirements

## 3. Agile Model

### Explanation

Agile is a **flexible and iterative approach** where software is developed in small parts. Feedback from customers is taken regularly, and changes are welcomed even late in development.

### Main Features

* Iterative development cycles
* Continuous customer involvement
* Minimal documentation
* Working software delivered frequently

### Advantages

* Quickly adapts to changing requirements
* Early delivery of useful software
* Strong collaboration between team and customer

### Disadvantages

* Less emphasis on documentation
* Hard to predict final cost and timeline
* Requires experienced and self-organized teams

## 4. Scrum Framework

### Explanation

Scrum is an **Agile framework** used to manage development work. It divides work into small time-boxed iterations called **sprints**, usually lasting 2–4 weeks.

### Main Features

* Defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Team)
* Daily stand-up meetings
* Sprint planning, review, and retrospective
* Prioritized backlog

### Advantages

* Fast development and delivery
* Continuous improvement
* High visibility of progress

### Disadvantages

* Depends heavily on team discipline
* Not suitable for very large or distributed teams
* Poor results if Scrum roles are not followed correctly

## 5. Spiral Model

### Explanation

The Spiral Model combines **iterative development** with **risk management**. The project progresses through loops (spirals), and risks are identified and handled in each loop before moving forward.

### Main Features

* Risk analysis in every cycle
* Prototyping used to reduce uncertainty
* Iterative and incremental development

### Advantages

* Ideal for large and complex projects
* Reduces project failure risk
* Allows early user feedback

### Disadvantages

* Complex and expensive
* Requires risk assessment expertise
* Not suitable for small projects

## 6. Extreme Programming (XP)

### Explanation

Extreme Programming is an Agile method focused on **high-quality code** and **continuous testing**. It encourages close communication between developers and customers.

### Main Features

* Pair programming
* Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Continuous integration
* Small, frequent releases

### Advantages

* Produces high-quality software
* Fast response to changes
* Reduced defects

### Disadvantages

* Needs constant customer involvement
* Not suitable for large teams
* Requires disciplined developers
